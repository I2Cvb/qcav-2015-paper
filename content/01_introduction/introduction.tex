\section{INTRODUCTION}\label{sec:introduction}

On a worldwide scale, \ac{cap} has been reported as the second most frequently diagnosed men cancers accounting for 13.6\,\%~\cite{Ferlay2010}. Statistically, the estimated number of new diagnosed cases was 899,000 with no less than 258,100 estimated deaths~\cite{Ferlay2010}. In United States, aside from skin cancer, \ac{cap} was declared to be the most commonly diagnosed cancer among men, implying that around one in seven men will be diagnosed with \ac{cap} during their lifetime~\cite{Siegel2014}.

Since its introduction in mid-1980s, \ac{psa} is widely used for \ac{cap} screening~\cite{Etzioni2002} and has shown to improve early detection of \ac{cap}~\cite{Chou2011}. However, several trials conducted in Europe and United States conclude that \ac{psa} screening suffers from low specificity~\cite{Andriole2009,Hugosson2010,Schroeder2012}. Thus, current research focus on developing new screening methods to improve \ac{cap} detection. In this perspective, \Ac{mri} techniques have recently shown promising results for \ac{cap} detection. Furthermore, three different modalities are currently investigated: (i) \ac{t2w} \ac{mri}, (ii) \ac{dce} \ac{mri} and (iii) \ac{adc}.

Several researches have been carried out in order to investigate the contributions of machine learning classifiers for \ac{cap} detection using 3T multi-parametric \ac{mri} such as \ac{svm}~\cite{Litjens2011,Litjens2012a,Litjens2014,Liu2013,Peng2013}, probabilistic boosting tree~\cite{Viswanath2011} or probabilistic neural network~\cite{Viswanath2011}.

In this research, we investigate the performance of gradient boosting for \ac{cap} detection using 3T multi-parametric \ac{mri}. Two different features extraction strategies have been chosen in order to feed the classifier: (i) voxel-based and (ii) 3D-texton-based. An evaluation of both strategies as well as the contribution of each modality is provided.
