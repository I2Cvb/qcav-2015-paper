\section{CONCLUSION}\label{sec:conclusion}

In this study, an exhaustive analysis of classification of 3T multi-parametric \ac{mri} data using a gradient boosting classifier has been carried out. The best classification performances are obtained by extracting the features using a 3D texton-based strategy and using the information from all the modalities as well as the zonal information. A maximum sensitivity and specificity of 86.9\% and 84.6\% respectively, are reached.

Two avenues for future research can be explored. First, the registration of the multi-parametric data has been discarded and could be performed ahead of the classification to study the possible improvements implied. Then, other features than intensities could be extracted and the results could be compared with the described experiments here, since that the dataset used is public.
